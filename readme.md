## Objective
Develop a machine learning tool that predicts house prices based on various datasets and ML features like linear regression, feature engineering, etc., while providing insightful data visualizations to understand housing data trends.

---

## Dataset Description
- **Dataset Name:** `Housing.csv`  
- **Number of Instances:** Not specified  
- **Number of Attributes:** 12  
- **Attribute Breakdown:**
  - **Categorical Attributes:** `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, etc.
  - **Numerical Attributes:** `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, etc.
- **Handling Missing Values:**
  - Categorical columns were imputed using the most frequent values.
  - Numerical columns were imputed using the mean.

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Loaded the housing dataset using `pandas`.
- Encoded categorical variables (`yes/no` to `1/0`) and scaled numerical columns.
- Implemented feature engineering, including interactions between numerical features (commented out to optimize accuracy).

### 2. Statistical Analysis
- Derived basic statistical insights using:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Correlation heatmap  
- Performed regression analysis on significant features to identify patterns with the target variable (`price`).

### 3. Machine Learning Model
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression  
- **Pipeline Implementation:**
  - Preprocessing with numerical and categorical transformations.
  - Supervised learning using Linear Regression.  
- **Train-Test Split:** 90% training, 10% testing.  
- **Metrics:**
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): *Calculated*  
  - R² Score: *Reported*  
- **Model Export:** Saved as `house_price_model.pkl` for integration with the GUI.

## Data Visualization
Implemented using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze continuous and categorical data:
- **Feature-Specific Distributions:** Histograms and boxplots.  
- **Regression Plots:** Significant feature vs. price.

---

## Dependencies and Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `seaborn`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `tkinter`  
- **Additional Tools:**
  - `OneHotEncoder` for categorical data.  
  - `StandardScaler` for normalization.
